ODC2_DashCrew
=============

ODC2 Demo released at Rewired 2010 demoparty by demo "group" DashCrew for the Odyssey²/Videopac videogame.

This code is the result of my ongoing experimentation with lowlevel programming 
for the Magnavox Odyssey² (a.k.a. VIDEOPAC G7000) video game.
It is written in 8048 assembly language.
You can learn more about it here: http://soeren.informationstheater.de/g7000/

---------------------------------
It has been awarded in 3rd place in the 
Rewired2010 demo party in Maaseik, Belgium.

Group: DashCrew

Code:
Felipe Sanches - Juca
Leandro Lameiro

Sound:
Niels van Dijkhuizen - (Nebulah)
---------------------------------

== Platform details ==
- First demo ever for the Phillips VIDEOPAC G7000 (Europe) / Magnavox Odyssey² (USA/Brazil)
- 8-bit video game console released in 1978

cpu:
- Intel 8048 at 5,37 MHz
- 64 bytes of RAM

graphics:
- 160x200 (without framebuffer), 16 colors
- max 12 single-color chars on screen at a given moment

audio:
1-bit sound output generated by shifting a 24-bit buffer + white noise channel

== GNU/Linux ==
You can build it by running "make rom"
By running "make" it will create a ROM file and load it into the o2em emulator

== Windows ==
Install o2em emulator and run the rom image in it.

== Dependencies ==
* asl (8048 assembler): http://john.ccac.rwth-aachen.de:8000/as/download.html
* python interpreter

== Emulator ==
You will need an Odyssey² emulator to run the compiled code.

Obviously you can also write the ROM file to a real cartridge and use your old
Odyssey² console, but that's certainly harder.

== Licensing ==
This code is released under the terms of the GNU General Public License 
version 2 or later.
